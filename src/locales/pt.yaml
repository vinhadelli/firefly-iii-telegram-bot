  👋 Olá! Esse bot te ajuda a cadastrar transações rapidamente no Firefly III.
  Ele também pode gerenciar algumas das entidades do Firefly.
needToSet: 'Para começar a usar esse bot, você precisa informar algumas configurações:'
setFireflyUrl: '  - *🔗 Firefly URL* - A URL da sua instância do Firefly'
setFireflyAccessToken: '  - *🔑 Access Token* criado no site do Firefly'

  🤖 Please navigate to bot *🔧 Settings* section and set up some stuff for using the bot.   
      
  ❕ To add a transaction, send an amount. It can be a number, or a math expression,
  like `100-5*3`.
  Upon receiving amount, bot will ask additional questions for transaction parameters.
    
  You can also add transactions that do not require additional questions from the bot,
  by sending transaction description and an amount, like so
    
  `Cafe 35`
    
  In this case a new withdrawal transaction from the default asset account and 
  description `Cafe` with amount of `35` will be created.
    
  ✨ Going further you can set up different *Rules* in a corresponding section of
  Firefly III, in which case all your bot transactions will be created respecting those
  rules.

      ⚠️ The destination account currency (*${destCurrency}*) is different than the source account currency (*${sourceCurrency}*)!
      Type in the foreign amount i.e. the amount in the destination account currency.  
        
      💡 You can use the arithmetic signs for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to
      perform the appropriate operation on the source account amount of the transaction.  
        
      For example, `*15` would multiply the initial amount by 15 to get the foreign amount.

    badAmountTyped: 'An amount should be a number. Type in new amount please:'
    badDescriptionTyped: 'Description needs to be text. Type in new description please:'
    typeNewAmount: >
      Type in new amount.

      💡 You can use the arithmetic signs for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to perform the appropriate operation on the current value of the transaction.

      For example, "+35" would add 35 to existing amount of transaction.
